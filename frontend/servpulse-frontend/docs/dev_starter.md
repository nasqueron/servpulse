# Quick Starter

The Vue.js application was created using the `npm init vue@3.3.2` command. To recreate the same environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Once the project is pulled, navigate to the project directory and install the project dependencies:
   ```
   cd servpulse-frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. You can now start the development server and run your Vue.js application:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

By following these steps, you will have a new Vue.js application with the same configuration choices as the original code.
